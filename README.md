# API-Helper

Simple Package that can set up easy webrequests. 
<br>
Read and Use the TestAPI monobehaviour in the TestScene to understand the only requirements for this to work.
<br>
Generally only use the facade "ApiServices" class and let it create the corrresponding apiservice.
<br><br>
Coulda/shoulda/woulda extend this to not only set JSON accept headers.

<i>Testing doesn't test authentication and bearer tokens</i>
